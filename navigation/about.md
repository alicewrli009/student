### Journey through Life

These are the schools I have been to

- 🏫 I went to Monterey Ridge Elemetary School

### Culture, Family, and Fun

Everything for me, as for many others, revolves around family and faith.

- My mother told me that I was Danish, English. and Irish, here is my researched [family tree]({{site.baseurl}}/images/about/familytree.png)
- My family is pretty big as I have been married twice, my 1st wife passed away.  We have had 5 kids, 4 adopted by me, 1 biological.  Plus, there are three grandkids.  My name to my grandkids is Abuilito.
- The gallery of pics has some of my family, fun, culture and faith memories.
