    "## 🧭 Comparing Myself to the Beginning of the Year\n",
    "\n",
    "At the start of the year, I didn’t really understand how code worked, I just followed the steps without knowing *why* things happened.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, after learning **Big Idea 3: Algorithms and Programming**, I can confidently explain and apply key coding concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  **Variables:** I learned how to store, update, and use data efficiently in programs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "-  **Functions / Procedures:** I can group code into reusable blocks that make programs cleaner and easier to manage.  \n",
    "\n",
    "-  **Parameters:** I understand how parameters make procedures flexible so they can handle different inputs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "-  **Loops and Conditionals:** I know how to use loops to repeat actions and conditionals to make decisions in an algorithm.  \n",
    "\n",
    "-  **Calling and Combining Procedures:** I’ve practiced connecting one function’s output to another’s input to build more complex programs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Algorithm Design:** I can break big problems into smaller parts and write clear, step-by-step instructions for solving them.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ve also grown in **collaboration** this year:  \n",
    "-  Learned to explain my reasoning and communicate clearly when coding with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Worked through debugging and brainstorming as a team.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Divided tasks and helped others understand their parts of the project.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, I’ve gone from just *following code* to really *understanding and creating* it. I feel much more confident and creative as a problem solver. "

    "This sprint built the foundation for everything else — it helped me feel like an actual web developer.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 **Fundamentals of JavaScript/Python Sprint**\n",
    "\n",
    "This sprint was where I really started to **think like a programmer**. I began to understand how logic drives everything behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Practiced **writing functions** to make code modular and reusable.  \n",

    "\n",
    "### 🌴 **West Coast Travel Quest**\n",
    "\n",
    "This was my favorite sprint because it combined creativity, storytelling, and coding skills all at once! I got to build a travel website that reflected my interests while using more advanced programming techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Designed interactive **travel pages** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  \n",
    "-  Added **animations and transitions** to make the website feel alive and engaging.  \n",
    "-  Learned how to **organize code** with reusable components and clean formatting.  \n",
    "-  Practiced **testing and debugging** to make sure everything ran smoothly.  \n",
    "-  Used design thinking to consider the **user experience (UI)** — how others would navigate and enjoy the site.  \n",
    "- Showed me how front-end coding works\n",
    "- Incorporated images, hover effects, and buttons for a more dynamic visual story.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This sprint made me realize that programming isn’t just about logic — it’s also a creative form of expression. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even though there were struggles, we perservered and it all came together at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
