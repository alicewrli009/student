    "1. **Practice tracing** - 10 algorithm problems traced on paper\n",
    "2. **Truth tables drill** - Create tables for 5 complex boolean expressions\n",
    "3. **Read questions twice** - Mark all \"TWO\", \"LEAST\", \"NOT\" keywords\n",
    "4. **Test negative numbers** - Always try negative/zero/boundary cases\n",
    "5. **Review compression** - Lossy vs lossless, when data is recoverable\n",
    "6. **Binary/exponents** - Review powers of 2, exponential vs linear growth"
